This repo, as its name states, serves as a container for all the different tasks we have identified as necessary in order to achieve by the end of January a torque-controlled walking demo for KOROIBOT. Let us clarify a couple of details about the motivations for this repo and how we believe it can best used to improve our collaborative work.

1. The issues of this repo correspond to the different tasks that have been assigned for the final demo. We have classified these tasks in three levels :

- **LOW LEVEL**: Tasks related to low-level software issues and mechanical improvements necessary for proper walking.
- **MID LEVEL** : Tasks related to components/modules that will eventually constitute the walking controller.
- **HIGH LEVEL**: Tasks related to tuning, testing or comparing different walking controllers, or the same one with modified components.

2. The former are the main classification levels of our tasks, and they're reflected in their repo labels as: LOW-LEVEL, MID-LEVEL and HIGH-LEVEL. Besides this main classification system, you will also find labels according to their priority as: HIGH-PRIORITY, NORMAL-PRIORITY and LOW-PRIORITY. The reamining labels correspond to help-wanted (tasks that haven't been assigned to anyone in particular), question (tasks that are actually questions addressed to the whole team searching for a collective answer and to keep a register of the chosen solution), subtask (subtasks of the main tasks already defined and labeled), wontdo (tasks that may lose priority at some point and then disregarded).

3. Another Github feature that will be useful to track our work are the so-called Milestones. Milestones are simply a collection of issues aimed at achieving a specific goal. e.g. Floating Base State Estimation, to which you can also assign a due date.

4. The previous are all features that most of us have previously seen and used. However, the tool that will give additional value to all those beloved Github features (i.e. labels, milestones and assignees) is a Google Chrome extension I'm using called ZenHub. This extension which is already in alfa stage, adds additional tools to the Github UI online, exploiting the latter mentioned features in the form of Boards.

The board that I have set up so far consists of different columns, each giving us an idea of the progress of each task and how far/close we are to achieve our goal. You can drag and drop issues from one column to the other according to their status:

Backlog: Contains all the unsorted issues/tasks.
To Do: Issues with the current highest priority that are meant to get started.
In Progress: Tasks that have been already engaged and are under development.
Reviewing: Tasks that have been finished and are in the process of reviewing and testing.
Done: Tasks that are utopically done.

In case you want to be able to see the boards on your computer you only need to install Google Chrome and then the following extension: https://www.zenhub.io/ Plain and simple. Once you log into Github, when you go to the WB-Team-Issues repo on the right hand side you will find an additional icon, just above the issues one, with Boards written next to it.

Please check the tasks/issues you have been assigned to and change if necessary. In those issues in which you're supposed to collaborate but you haven't been assigned, put your name in a comment as: cc @githubusername. If there are main tasks missing please add it in the form of an issue and tag appropriately. If it is a subtask of another main issue, tag it with the subtask label. Please cross-reference your tasks with their corresponding issue in another repository, e.g.
